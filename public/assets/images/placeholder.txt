This is a placeholder file for images. In a real project, you would add actual image files here:

1. hero.jpg - A professional image representing healing and transformation
2. sir-profile.jpg - Professional headshot of the practitioner
3. logo.png - Clinic logo

These images should be high-quality, professional photos that align with the therapeutic nature of the clinic.
